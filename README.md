# SoundsUnderground.com (2000–2003)

## Overview

**SoundsUnderground.com** was a pioneering internet radio platform developed and managed single-handedly by Andrew John Holland from 2000 to 2003, during the AOL and dial-up to broadband internet transition era. As Andrew’s first major IT project, it launched him headfirst into the tech world, spanning four years and culminating in the successful sale of the domain and database to a larger Seattle-based internet channel in Q4 2003. The platform showcased underground DJ artists from Vancouver and Seattle, featuring one-hour sets from approximately 40 DJs, including John Morgan, a Vancouver-based DJ and sound engineer at Electronic Arts Canada at that time he project was SSX Tricky. Built using a Pentium III computer with an ergonomic keyboard and leveraging high-speed coaxial internet, this self-taught endeavor demonstrated technical innovation, entrepreneurial vision, and a passion for advancing IT expertise in web development.
