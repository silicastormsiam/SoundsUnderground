## 🚀 Overview

### 🎧 Project Significance

**SoundsUnderground.com** was a pioneering internet radio platform developed and managed single-handedly by **Andrew John Holland** from 2000 to 2003—an era when the world was transitioning from dial-up screeches to broadband dreams. This wasn’t just a tech experiment—it was Andrew’s red pill moment into IT. Built during the AOL days, it spanned four formative years and culminated in the platform’s successful sale to a Seattle-based internet channel in Q4 2003.

## 🔊 Music Genres

The sonic pulse of **SoundsUnderground** was driven by the after-hours of Vancouver and Seattle:

* House
* Deep House
* Progressive House
* Funky House
* Funky Breakbeats

Featuring tracks from legends like **Bob Sinclar**, **Daft Punk**, **Armand Van Helden**, **Dimitri from Paris**, **Joey Negro**, and **Modjo**—the scene was alive and streaming.

## 🧠 Technical Activities

* **Hardware**: Ran on a Pentium III with an ergonomic keyboard and high-speed coaxial (long before fiber was cool).
* **Streaming**: Leveraged **Nullsoft’s Shoutcast** for MP3 broadcasting.
* **DJ Expertise**: Collaborated with **John Morgan**, sound engineer at Electronic Arts Canada (SSX Tricky era).
* **Website & Database**: Hand-coded front-end and custom backend to manage DJ profiles and track metadata.
* **Queue System**: Developed a “Play Next” automation for seamless DJ set transitions.
* **FTP Mastery**: Managed large MP3 uploads and hosting via FTP.

---

## 💼 Business Model

* **Storage Fees**: DJs paid to upload, supporting server infrastructure.
* **Free Listener Access**: Ensured reach and underground growth.
* **Exit Strategy**: Sold successfully to a Seattle company in Q4 2003.
